## Overview

This project involved developing a comprehensive academic planning platform called "stu" that revolutionizes how students approach scheduling, advising, and graduation planning. Using modern web development practices and user-centered design principles, I created an intelligent system that automates many of the tedious aspects of academic planning.

The primary purpose of this app is to:

- Automate course scheduling based on degree requirements and student preferences
- Provide intelligent advising recommendations for optimal graduation pathways
- Create visual graduation mapping to help students track their academic progress
- Streamline the academic planning process for better student outcomes
